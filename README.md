TASK DISCRIPTION: We focuses on developing a real-time chat application using WebSockets and frontend technologies. The objective is to enable instant communication between users without reloading the page. The application should provide a responsive chat interface where users can type messages, send them, and see incoming messages appear immediately. WebSockets are used to maintain a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing continuous two-way data transfer. The chat interface displays message history, ensuring that both sent and received messages are visible during the session. Proper UI design and responsiveness are required to make the application user-friendly across different screen sizes. This task demonstrates an understanding of real-time data handling, frontend interactivity, and efficient communication using WebSocket technology.
